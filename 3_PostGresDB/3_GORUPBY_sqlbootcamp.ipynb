    "- SQL provides a variety of aggregate functions. and PostGreSQL is no exception.\n",
    "- The main ide behind aggregate function is to take multiple inputs and return a single output.\n",
    "- The most common aggregate functions are:\n",
    "    - AVG(): returns the average value\n",
    "    - COUNT(): returns number of values\n",
    "    - MAX(): returns maximum value\n",
    "    - MIN(): returns minimum value\n",
    "    - SUM(): returns the sum of all values\n",
    "- Aggregate function calls happen only in the SELECT clause or the HAVING clause.\n",
    "- Special Notes:\n",
    "    - AVG() retursn a floating point value many decimal places (e.g. 2.342418 ...)\n",
    "        - You can use ROUND() to specify precision after the decimal.        \n",
